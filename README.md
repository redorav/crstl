# CRSTL
An alternative or complementary STL that focuses on fast compiles and runtime, often focusing on fixed size alternatives for containers and functionality. Some of the guiding principles are:

· No RTTI
· No exceptions thrown or exception handling
· No external includes
· Containers that avoid heap allocations
· Simple C++ code as clear and unobfuscated as possible
·
